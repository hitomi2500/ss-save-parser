This is a QT-based parser for Sega Saturn RAM Backup (aka Power Memory), Internal RAM, and possibly
other media images. It can load/save/show image's content and extract/insert/delete single saves in a customizable
way. Virtually any sector size (64,256,512,whatever) is suppoted, and conversion is available. Importing of a Datel's compressed images is supported.
Support for a direct connection to Sega Saturn is planned.
