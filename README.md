This is a QT-based parser for Sega Saturn RAM Backup (aka Power Memory), Internal RAM, and possibly
other media images. It can show image's content, extract/insert single saves in a customizable
way, and possibly edit saves (coming soon).
There might be a hardware support for direct Sega Saturn connection later, not now.
